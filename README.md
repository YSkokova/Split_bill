# Split_bill
my hyperskill course project Split Bill.


You have planned a dinner with your friends today. It's the right time to add them to your program. You need to be sure how many friends are joining you for dinner including you.

The idea is to take names from user input. Store them in a dictionary.

For example, if five friends are joining including you, you need to add five people to the dictionary so that you can access/update the corresponding bill value later.
